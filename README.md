## Simulation Tools for Small Area Estimation

Tools for the simulation of data in the context of small area estimation. Combine all steps of your simulation - from data generation over drawing samples to model fitting - in one object. This enables easy modification and combination of different scenarios. You can store your results in a folder or start the simulation in parallel.
