# Todo
- Maybe a function `sim_gen_generic` is useful - more intuitive than closures all the time.
- summary.sim_setup: print the call of the generator/sampling function/etc.
- Print the call of all functions in the sequence in which they will be applied.
- Documentation for preconfigured setups!!!
- example for sim_comp_sample in help file
