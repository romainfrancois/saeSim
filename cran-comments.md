This is a maintenance release due to the upcoming release of dplyr.

## Test environments
* ubuntu (on travis-ci)
* win-builder
* local ubuntu (17.04), R 3.3.3

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs

I received one Note:

Maintainer: 'Sebastian Warnholz <wahani@gmail.com>'

New maintainer:
  Sebastian Warnholz <wahani@gmail.com>
Old maintainer(s):
  Sebastian Warnholz <Sebastian.Warnholz@fu-berlin.de>
  
Which is a necessary change since my academic email address will not remain
active for very long.


## Downstream dependencies
To the best of my knowledge there are no reverse dependencies to check.
